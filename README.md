Support vector machine algorithm to create a model that can classify Drebin dataset as malware or non malware,
based on the training we give to the model.
Being able to identify malware or non malware is a binary classification
problem as apps are classified as either 'Malware ' or 'Non Malware ' and
nothing else. Also, this is a supervised learning problem, as we will be feeding
a labeled data-set into the model, that it can learn from, to make future
predictions.
